# DareDrop
### Daredrop is a decentralized, non-custodial, on-chain game that utilizes the embrace of risk in order to enable real yield for liquidity providers. A first-of-its-kind defi primitive, Daredrop aims to become a welcome addition to the defi ethos in contributing a novel and modular approach to yield.
